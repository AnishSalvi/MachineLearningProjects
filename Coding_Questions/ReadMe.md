# Helpful Scripts to Know for Coding Interviews
Some of these functions do not require any built in libraries like sklearn. 

**KMeans:** A KMeans implementation for unsupervised clustering. 

**Landmark_Registration:** An implementation of image transformation via least squares and gradient descent. 

**KNN:** A K Nearest Neighbor implementation for supervised learning classification. 

**Logistic_Regression:** A Logistic Regression implementation for binary classification.

**NumPy_MaxPooling:** A 2D max-pooling function written completely in NumPy with a functional equivalent in PyTorch. This function can be easily adapted for 3D tasks as well. 

**NumPy_Convolution:** A 2D convolution function written completely in NumPy with a functional equivalent in PyTorch. This function can be easily adapted for 3D tasks as well. 

**Perceptron:** A perceptron implementation for binary classification. 

**SVM:** A support vector machine implementation for binary classification. 

**Naive_Bayes:** Naive Bayes implementation for binary classification. 

**Rand_Dataset:** A random dataset for batch loading which has working argparse commands.
