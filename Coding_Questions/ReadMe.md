# Helpful Functions to Know for Coding Interviews

**KMeans:** A KMeans implementation for unsupervised clustering that does not require any built-in libraries like sklearn. 

**KNN:** A K Nearest Neighbor implementation for supervised classification that does not require any built-in libraries like sklearn. 

**Logistic_Regression:** A Logistic Regression implementation for binary classification that does not require any built-in libraries like sklearn.

**NumPy_MaxPooling:** A 2D max-pooling function written completely in NumPy with a functional equivalent in PyTorch. This function can be easily adapted for 3D tasks as well. 

**NumPy_Convolution:** A 2D convolution function written completely in NumPy with a functional equivalent in PyTorch. This function can be easily adapted for 3D tasks as well.
