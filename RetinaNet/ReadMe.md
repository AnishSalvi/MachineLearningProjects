RetinaNet

The one stage detector, RetinaNet, was selected for this particular assignment owing to its past success in outperforming two-stage detectors, like Faster RCNN. The RetinaNet consists of a ResNet and feature pyramid network backbone for extracting salient image features and two smaller networks for fitting bounding boxes and predicting class labels. Previously, two stage detectors implemented region proposal networks to locate potential object locations before conducting a classification of each candidate region. However, one stage detectors which combined region proposal and classification into a single network suffered from having a much larger set of proposed regions to sift through, resulting in reduced accuracy. RetinaNet implemented a focal loss, which weighed more difficult training samples heavier than their simpler counterparts, facilitating greater one stage detector accuracy.
