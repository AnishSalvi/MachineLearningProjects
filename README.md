# Machine Learning Projects
This library contains various scripts useful for running machine learning projects, including performing hyperparameter optimization and k-fold cross validation while storing results with WandB. Some work is currently under development. 

**Author's Note:** Some projects associated with the Master's Thesis are published on Google Scholar. https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SJCymuoAAAAJ&hl=en
